- Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! I will use this to track my learning progress as a Developer.
2022 is the year that I want to transition from a part-time hobby developer into a career. 
- So from now on, I'll do my best to follow industry best-practises to the best of my ability, and also add some of my own fun and creativity into the learning process. 
- Part of being a good collaborative developer includes being able to write documentation using markdown.
