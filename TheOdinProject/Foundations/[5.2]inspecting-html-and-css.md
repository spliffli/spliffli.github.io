**Directions**
- [ ] Go through the following sections of the official Chrome DevTools docs:
    - [ ] Overview: don’t navigate to any other pages linked here; just get familiar with what tools are available in the DevTools, rather than how to use all of them right now.
- [ ] Open Chrome DevTools: similar to what we went over above, but with some nice extras.
    - [ ] CSS: be sure to follow along with any interactive instructions! Note that while you haven’t used CSS Grid yet, you should still read the “Inspect CSS Grid” section in order to be familiar with how to inspect it in case you see it in the wild.
- [ ] Get Started With Viewing And Changing The DOM: skip through any part that uses the JavaScript console.
