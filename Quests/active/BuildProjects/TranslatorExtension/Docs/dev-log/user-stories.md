- [ ] Can highlight any text and have a translated version pop up, so that I can quickly translate a single part of a page
- [ ] Can translate entire content of page or main content/article from page and display in various formats to help internalize learning target language. These formats include:
    - [ ] __Split Page View:__ Can show two versions of the same article side by side, and when any part of one is highlighted, the corresponding part in the other language will also be highlighted
    - [ ] __Alternating Paragraphs:__ Can show a paragraph's translation directly under original paragraph, before the next paragraph, so that less time is spent looking back and forth accross the screen.
    - [ ] __Alternating sentences__ Similar to alternating paragraphs, but even more granular because it will break the article into sentences and alternate between original and translation.
- [ ] Can highlight any part of a sentence and it will highlight the entire sentence and the corresponding translated sentence
- [ ] Can highlight any word and have the translated word highlighted in the same color, which is different from the sentence color
