# Translator Extension for Chrome-based Browsers

Hello and welcome to anyone who is reading this. It's important to note that I'm writing this docunent firstly for myself to be able to keep track of things, so I make no garauntee of this necessarily making sense or being without mistakes, since I am approaching this project as a learning excercise.



My goal is to make a browser extension that I will use myself to help learn German. Specifically, I'm going to use it to learn how to use programming related vocabulary to express my ideas as fully as I'm able to in English. 



This should help bring me to a level of comprehension and self-articulation to be able to work in  a German-speaking or bi-lingual collaborative developement environment. The translator tool is intended to be used only as a learning crutch to help internalize the concepts well enough that I'll be ready to work in a real German-speaking environment and know what I'm talking about, not relying on the translator as much in the moment.



With that being said, I'm going to outline the first steps to approach this, then work through it and document each step, similarly to how I've been approaching TheOdinProject, except for an actual idea of my own. Translator apps are not a new idea, but the exact way I want it to function doesn't exist how I imagine it could be more useful to my use-case.
